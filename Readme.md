Business study economic activities in Portugal - RNCP - Edgar Tom√©

The goal of this project was to create a data set to future analyse of the evolution of the economy in factors of production activities, efficiency and return, internationalization of the economy, and they sub factors.


Production Activities - (Export, Import, Production)

Efficiency and Return - (Apparent labour productivity, Investment rate, Degree of production)

Internationalization - (Degree of exposure to international trade, Export intensity, Import penetration rate)


The plan of the project was to chouse a data source that was able to provide the different factors of the economy in Portugal, by industry and the evolution along the years, and retrieve data from the choice source. 

In this case the data source dint had API access, so for retrieving the data was by download of Excel files. Import the data to python script for clean, the none necessary columns and rows and nan values, and the years with complete data and the same industries in all tables.

After export of the clean data in to CSV files, imported the files in to a new script of Python, to produce visualizations, to perform a primary data analysis and verify that there were no outlier values, our still missing values and data it no relevance for the study. If necessary, return to the script in python and perform more data clean, to have the files exported in csv, to be imported in to database and future analysis

Create a database, create tables for import of the data information in all the clean files retrieved in csv for all the factors for analysis, and produce some queries that can give some evolution of the economy production.
